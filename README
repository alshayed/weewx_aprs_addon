This is a quick add-on for the Weewx system to allow it to send APRS weather
packets to a file, for use by APRX as a packet comment. It is based on the 
addon by bradmc, which communicated directly with a TNC.

This was created using Weewx version 1.13.1, and has also been tested with
version 1.14.1. The author has indicated that there will be a more modular
facility for adding RESTful protocols in a future release, so this code
will probably be obsolete before long.
It has also been tested successfully with Weewx version 2.5.0.

Paths:
I installed this on a Debian box. The relevant files for modification are:
/etc/weewx/weewx.conf
/usr/share/weewx/weewx/restful.py
/etc/aprx.conf

Please send any improvements to Brad McConahay at brad@mcconahay.com.

    Modified to work with weewx 2.6.3, now uses weewx/bin/weewx/restx.py instead of restful.py

    Sample beacon for APRX:

        <beacon>
            beaconmode radio
            cycle-size 16m
            beacon srccall "MYCALL-13" dstcall "APRS" via "RFONLY" file "/tmp/weewx-aprs.txt"
        </beacon>
